Each precursor is awarded a score based on which fragments match the spectrum. The score assigned to each fragment depends on its intensity rank. The default scheme is 8,4,4,2,2,1,1. That is, if the 1st, 3rd, and 7th ranking fragments matched the spectrum, the precursor would be awarded a score of 8+4+1=13. If all 7 of the fragments matched, the precursor would be awarded a score of 22. For normal instrument settings on an Orbitrap or Astral mass analyzer, the mass tolerance is about +/- 5-15 ppm and 15 is a reasonable default score threshold. However, for instruments with less mass accuracy (Sciex ZenoTOF 7600 or different Orbitrap scan settings), the score threshold may need to be set higher, perhaps to 20. It may be worthwile to test different values when searching data from a new instrument or sample type. In order to pass the first search, a precursor need only pass the threshold and score sufficiently well in at least one of the MS data files.\nfirst_search.fragment_settings.max_rank: Search against only the n'th most abundant fragment for each precursor. Including more fragments can improve performance but increase memory consumption, and the search could take longer. From experience, there are diminishing returns after 25-50 fragments. \nquant_search.fragment_settings.max_rank: See above \nquant_search.fragment_settings.n_isotopes: If searching with non-Altimeter libraries (not recommended), such as Prosit or UniSpec, this should be set to 1 as the second fragment isotopes will not be calculated accurately.\nacquisition.nce: This is the initial guess for the normalized collision energy that will best align the Altimeter Library with the empirical data. Altimeter values should agree with those from Thermo Instruments manufactured in Bremen Germany. If upon inspection of the quality control plots the initial guess is far from the estimated value, it might be possible to improve search results slightly by re-searching with a better initial guess.\nacquisition.quad_transmission.fit_from_data: Estimate the quad transmission function from the data. Otherwise defaults to symmetric, smooth function. \noptimization.machine_learning.max_samples: This is the maximum number of PSMs to use for training the LightGBM model. These PSMs need to comfortably fit in memory in addition to the spectral library. As a rule of thumb, 7M rows is about 1GB. At the default maximum of 50M rows, the PSMs table will consume 7GB of memory.\nDuring LightGBM training, any missing feature values are replaced with the column median. If a column is entirely missing, the values are filled with zero of the appropriate type.\nglobal.isotope_settings.combine_traces: Some precursors may be split accross different acquisition windows. Pioneer refers to these as seperate isotope traces. When set to true, Pioneer does not distinguish between a precursor's isotope traces. They are combined for scoring and quantitation. With a clever acquisition scheme this can increase the number of data points accross chromatographic peaks. This is recomended only for acquisition windows 2-4 m/z. It should also be combined with aquisition.quad_transmission.fit_from_data = true.

Pioneer uses Chronologer to predict peptide retention times and is optimized to use Altimeter for fragment ion intensity predictions.\nCollision Energy Independent Spectral Libraries: Rather than predicting a single intensity value for each fragment ion, Altimeter predicts 4 B-spline coefficients. Evaluating the fragment splines at a given collision energy gives a fragment ion intensity. Pioneer calibrates the library to find the optimal collision energy value to use for each MS data file in an experiment. In this way, it is possible to use a single spectral library for different instruments and scan settings. \nFragment Isotope Correction: Fragment isotope distributions depend on precursor isotope distributions as distorted by quadrupole mass filtering. Altimeter addresses this by predicting total fragment ion intensities rather than monoisotopic ones. Pioneer then accurately re-isotopes these library spectra using methods from Goldfarb et al.. This is particularly important for narrow-window DIA methods where precursor isotopic envelopes frequently straddle multiple windows.\nQaudrupole Transmission Modeling: For narrow-window data, Pioneer can optionally estimate a quadrupole-transmission efficiency function for more accurate re-isotoping. \nIntensity-Aware Fragment Index Search: Pioneer implements a fast fragment index search inspired by MSFragger and Sage. Pioneer's implementation uniquely leverages accurate fragment intensity predictions from in silico libraries to improve both speed and specificity of the search.\nLinear Regression onto Library Templates: Pioneer explains each observed mass spectrum as a linear combination of template spectra from the library. To reduce quantitative bias from interfering signals, Pioneer minimizes the pseudo-Huber loss rather than squared error. This provides robust quantification even in complex spectra. For other examples of linear regression applied to DIA analyses, see Specter and Chimerys.\nScalability: Pioneer was designed to scale to large experiments with many MS data files. Memory consumption remains constant as the number of data files in an experiment grows large.
