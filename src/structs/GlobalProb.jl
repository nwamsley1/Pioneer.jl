    GlobalPrecFeatures{N}

Compact per-precursor feature summary for global probability model training.
Aggregates scores across runs into a fixed-size feature vector for ML-based
global precursor probability estimation.

# Fields
- `top_scores::NTuple{N, Float32}`: Top N :prec_prob values across runs (descending), padded with -1.0f0
- `n_scores_available::Int32`: Actual number of runs with scores (â‰¤ N)
- `stats::NTuple{5, Float32}`: (mean, max, min, std, skewness); -1.0f0 for undefined
- `counts::NTuple{3, Int32}`: (n_runs_with_score, n_runs_total, n_above_thresh)
- `deltas::NTuple{2, Float32}`: (top1 - top2, top2 - top3); -1.0f0 if undefined
- `logodds_baseline::Float32`: Baseline probability from logodds(p, sqrt_n_runs)

# Notes
- Sentinel value -1.0f0 indicates missing/undefined features (not 0.0 or NaN)
- Statistics computed using streaming algorithms (no full array materialization)
- `logodds_baseline` serves dual purpose: feature input and fallback score
