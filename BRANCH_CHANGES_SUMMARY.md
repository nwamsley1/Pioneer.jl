# Branch Changes Summary: improve-parameter-tuning-robustness

## Overview
This branch contains 81 commits focused on improving the robustness of parameter tuning and fixing critical issues in the SearchDIA pipeline, particularly around protein group scoring and small dataset handling.

## Major Changes

### 1. ParameterTuningSearch Enhancements (40+ commits)
The most significant changes were made to improve parameter tuning robustness:

#### Core Improvements
- **3-Phase Convergence Strategy**: Simplified from complex multi-strategy to fixed 3-phase iteration
- **Intelligent Scan Selection**: Implemented FilteredMassSpecData for smart scan sampling
- **Adaptive Convergence**: Added bias detection, boundary sampling, and cross-run learning
- **Robust Fallback Mechanisms**: Graceful handling when insufficient data for parameter estimation

#### Key Features Added
- **FilteredMassSpecData** (`src/structs/FilteredMassSpecData.jl`): New 574-line module for intelligent scan selection
  - RT-based binning for uniform sampling
  - Scan quality filtering
  - Memory-efficient data access
  
- **Configurable Parameters**:
  - `max_parameter_tuning_scans`: Limit scan processing
  - `min_samples`: Convergence threshold
  - `topn_peaks`: Fragment selection
  - `intensity_filter_quantile`: Quality filtering

#### Bug Fixes
- Fixed RT bin indexing (1-based vs 0-based)
- Fixed ArrowTableReference length call
- Fixed bounds errors in summarize_precursor
- Fixed DataFrame type mismatches in quad tuning
- Fixed estimateKdeBins type errors

### 2. Protein Group Scoring Fixes (Recent Critical Fix)

#### The Problem
When probit regression was skipped (due to insufficient data), protein scores remained as log-sum scores instead of probabilities, causing the `logodds` function to fail.

#### The Solution (Today's Fix)
- **File**: `src/Routines/SearchDIA/SearchMethods/ScoringSearch/utils.jl`
- Added conversion from log-sum scores to probabilities when `skip_scoring = true`
- Formula: `p = 1 - exp(-pg_score)` converts log-sum to probability
- Added clamping to avoid numerical issues

#### Supporting Changes
- Added `skip_scoring` parameter throughout probit functions
- Improved logging to track protein group flow
- Fixed global score calculation to use minimum top_n of 1 (was 2)

### 3. XGBoost Model Updates
Recent changes to PSM scoring thresholds and parameters:
- Modified hyperparameters for simplified models
- Added more features to mid-tier model (1,000-100,000 PSMs)
- Adjusted regularization parameters

### 4. Testing Infrastructure

#### New Test Modules
- **EntrapmentAnalysis Module** (`test/entrapment_analyses/`): 
  - Comprehensive EFDR analysis using entrapment sequences
  - Protein-level and precursor-level analysis
  - 3,000+ lines of new testing code

#### New Unit Tests
- `test_filtered_mass_spec_data.jl`: Tests for intelligent scan selection
- `test_summarize_precursor.jl`: Tests for precursor summarization
- `test_shuffle_with_fixed_chars.jl`: Tests for decoy generation

### 5. Documentation Updates

#### New Documentation Files
- `ALTIMETER_FRAGMENT_FILTERING_*.md`: Fragment filtering issues and fixes
- `PROTEIN_GROUP_FILE_WRITING_FIX.md`: Protein group file handling
- `EMPTY_PROTEIN_GROUPS_ROOT_CAUSE.md`: Analysis of empty protein groups
- `PROBIT_*.md`: Multiple files on probit regression handling
- Various fix plans for specific issues

#### Updated Documentation
- `CLAUDE.md`: Updated with current development focus
- `README.md`: Simplified installation and usage instructions

### 6. Build System Changes

#### Removed
- Complex GitHub Actions workflows for multi-platform builds
- Docker support files
- Precompile data and scripts
- Windows installer configuration

#### Simplified
- Single CI workflow (`CI.yml`) replacing multiple workflows
- Removed release automation

## File Statistics

- **184 files changed**
- **12,178 insertions(+)**
- **37,653 deletions(-)**
- Net reduction of ~25,000 lines (simplified codebase)

## Key Technical Achievements

1. **Robust Small Dataset Handling**: System now gracefully handles datasets with <1,000 PSMs
2. **Intelligent Resource Management**: Scan selection reduces memory usage and improves speed
3. **Better Error Recovery**: Fallback mechanisms prevent pipeline failures
4. **Improved Scoring**: Fixed critical issues with protein group scoring for small datasets
5. **Enhanced Testing**: Comprehensive entrapment analysis framework

## Critical Fixes Applied Today

1. **Log-sum to Probability Conversion**: Ensures `logodds` function receives valid inputs
2. **Global Score Calculation**: Fixed to work with 3-file datasets
3. **Protein Group Filtering**: Resolved issue where all protein groups were filtered out

## Current State

The branch is now stable with all major issues resolved:
- ParameterTuningSearch is robust across all dataset sizes
- Protein scoring works correctly even when probit is skipped
- Small datasets (<20,000 PSMs) are handled gracefully
- All tests passing

## Next Steps (Not Yet Implemented)

- Probit regression for PSM scoring with <20,000 PSMs (plan written but not implemented)
- Further optimization of XGBoost hyperparameters
- Additional validation with diverse datasets
