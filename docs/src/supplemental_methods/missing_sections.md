## Critical Missing Content

These are essential components that are referenced but not explained, or are necessary for reproducibility.

### 1. Chronologer / Retention Time Prediction Model

**Priority:** ðŸ”´ **CRITICAL**

**Problem:**
Chronologer is mentioned twice in the document but never explained:
- **Line 66:** "retention times were aligned to Chronologer predictions using spline fitting"
- **Line 177:** "Pioneer constructs target-decoy sequence libraries as inputs to Altimeter and Chronologer for *in silico* spectrum prediction"

Throughout the document, "library retention time (iRT)" and "indexed retention time (iRT)" are used extensively (50+ references), but their initial source is never explained.

**What's Missing:**
1. **What is Chronologer?**
   - Is it a separate tool, or part of Pioneer?
   - What is its relationship to Pioneer and Altimeter?

2. **How does it work?**
   - What algorithm/model does it use for retention time prediction?
   - What are its inputs and outputs?
   - What training data was used?
   - Model architecture (if machine learning-based)

3. **How are iRT values assigned?**
   - How does Pioneer obtain initial iRT predictions for library peptides?
   - Are these predictions part of the spectral library generation?
   - What happens if Chronologer predictions are unavailable?

4. **Validation and accuracy**
   - What is the typical prediction accuracy?
   - How robust is it across different instrument types or gradients?

**Where to Add:**
- Option A: New subsection after Altimeter (between lines 149-169): `\subsection{Chronologer Retention Time Prediction}`
- Option B: Clarify in the introduction that Chronologer is an external tool and cite appropriately
- Option C: Add as part of "Spectral Library Sequence Generation" (line 176)

**Impact:** HIGH - Without this information, readers cannot understand:
- Where iRT values come from
- How to reproduce the analysis
- Why retention time alignment works

**Status:** [ ] Needs to be added

### 2. Fragment Scoring Function Table (Missing Table)

**Priority:** ðŸ”´ **CRITICAL**

**Problem:**
Referenced at **line 204** but table does not exist:
```latex
Table~\ref{tab:frag_score} gives the scoring function used throughout this work.
```

**What's Missing:**
A table showing the fragment scoring function that assigns weights based on fragment rank. The text says:
> "Assign each fragment a score, $s \in \mathbb{N}$, based on its rank, $r$. The scoring function is user defined and ought to assign greater weights to the more probable fragment ions."

**Required Table Content:**
| Rank ($r$) | Score ($s$) | Description |
|------------|-------------|-------------|
| 1 | ? | Top-ranked (most intense) fragment |
| 2 | ? | Second-ranked fragment |
| 3 | ? | Third-ranked fragment |
| ... | ... | ... |
| N | ? | Nth-ranked fragment |

Or, if formulaic:
- Provide the mathematical formula: $s(r) = f(r)$
- Explain the rationale (e.g., exponential decay, linear, etc.)
- State default values used in Pioneer

**Where to Add:**
- In Section 4 "Intensity-Aware Fragment Index Search" (around line 205)
- Add after the text that references it
- Label as `\label{tab:frag_score}`

**Impact:** HIGH - This directly affects:
- Fragment index scoring
- PSM ranking
- Reproducibility of search results

**Status:** [ ] Needs to be added

---

### 3. Spectral Similarity Scores Table (Missing Table)

**Priority:** ðŸ”´ **CRITICAL**

**Problem:**
Referenced at **line 389** but table does not exist:
```latex
These include the spectral similarity scores listed in Table~\ref{tab:simple_scores}
```

The text describes PSM features but doesn't list the spectral similarity scores.

**What's Missing:**
A table listing all spectral similarity metrics calculated by Pioneer for PSM scoring. Based on line 389, these are used as features in the first-pass search alongside:
- Charge state
- Number of missed cleavages
- Number of variably oxidized methionines
- Total ion current
- Number of matched y ions
- Mean fragment error
- Number of peaks in the spectrum

**Required Table Content:**
| Feature Name | Description | Formula (if applicable) | Range |
|--------------|-------------|------------------------|-------|
| Scribe Score | Intensity-weighted spectral similarity | (cited at line 354) | [0, 1] |
| Cosine Similarity | ? | ? | [0, 1] |
| Spectral Angle | ? | ? | [0, Ï€/2] |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

**Where to Add:**
- In Section 6 "First Pass Search" (around line 389)
- Add immediately after or before the text that references it
- Label as `\label{tab:simple_scores}`

**Note:** Line 171 also references `tab:simple_scores` for "Arrow table schema" which seems incorrect - this may need to be a different table (`tab:arrow_schema`).

**Impact:** HIGH - These scores are critical features for:
- PSM discrimination
- Probit regression model training
- FDR estimation

**Status:** [ ] Needs to be added

## Document Organization Issues

### 10. Incorrect Table Reference

**Priority:** ðŸŸ¡ **MEDIUM**

**Problem:**
**Line 171** references `tab:simple_scores` for Arrow table schema:
```latex
Pioneer-compatible arrow tables follow the schema in Table~\ref{tab:simple_scores}.
```

However, `tab:simple_scores` is supposed to contain spectral similarity scores (line 389), not the Arrow schema.

**Solutions:**
1. **Option A:** Create two separate tables
   - `tab:arrow_schema` - Arrow IPC format schema (referenced at line 171)
   - `tab:simple_scores` - Spectral similarity scores (referenced at line 389)

2. **Option B:** Fix the reference at line 171
   - Change to reference a new table: `Table~\ref{tab:arrow_schema}`
   - Add the Arrow schema table in the "File Conversion" section

**Recommended:** Option A - create both tables

**Impact:** MEDIUM - Causes confusion about what the table should contain

**Status:** [ ] Needs correction

## Notes for Authors

1. **Chronologer** - This is the #1 priority. Either:
   - Add a full methods section if it's part of your software suite
   - Add a brief explanation and citation if it's external/published
   - Explain if iRT values are obtained differently (e.g., from external tools, manual annotation, etc.)

2. **Missing Tables** - These are straightforward to add and are directly referenced in the text. Creating them will fix broken references and improve clarity.

3. **Additional Sections** - These would make the methods more complete, but prioritize based on:
   - Your target audience
   - Journal requirements
   - Space constraints
   - Whether this information will be in supplementary materials vs. main text

4. **Related Documents**
   - See `methods_review.md` for issues with existing content (typos, references, etc.)
   - This document (`missing_sections.md`) focuses on content that should be added

**Review completed:** 2025-10-30
**Reviewer notes:** The algorithmic and mathematical content in the methods is excellent and comprehensive. The main gaps are practical/implementation details and the Chronologer component which is referenced but never explained.
